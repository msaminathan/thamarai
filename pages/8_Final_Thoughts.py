st.write(
    "The true wisdom of ECC isn't just in the complex math; it's in its elegant efficiency. "
    "By moving from a multiplication problem over integers (like in RSA) to a **point multiplication problem on a curve**, "
    "ECC found a way to create a 'trapdoor' function that is incredibly difficult to reverse, but with far less computational effort."

st.write(
    "Think of ECC like a safe with a very specific, one-way combination lock. "
    "Your **private key** is the secret combination number. "
    "Your **public key** is the final, open state of the safe's dial after you've spun it many times."
)
st.write(
    "It's easy for you (and anyone with the private key) to quickly spin the dial to its final state, "
    "but it's virtually impossible for someone who only sees the final dial position to figure out how many times you spun it."

st.write(
    "ECC is not just a theoretical concept; it's the backbone of modern digital security. You've likely used it today without even knowing it."

st.markdown(
    """
    - **üåê HTTPS/TLS:** Most modern websites use ECC certificates for secure connections.
    - **‚Çø Blockchain:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies use the **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** to verify transactions. Your wallet address is a hashed version of your public key.
    - **üì± Mobile Devices:** Due to their smaller key sizes and lower power consumption, ECC is perfect for securing data on smartphones and smart cards.
    - **üîí Secure Messaging:** Apps like Signal and WhatsApp use ECC to provide end-to-end encryption.

st.write(
    "While ECC is secure against today's computers, the rise of large-scale **quantum computers** presents a future threat."
)
st.write(
    "An algorithm called **Shor's algorithm** could theoretically solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (and RSA's integer factorization problem) in a fraction of the time, breaking ECC security."
)
st.write(
    "This has led to the development of **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**, which aims to create new, quantum-resistant algorithms. The cryptographic world is already preparing for the transition to these new standards."
