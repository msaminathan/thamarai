    Welcome to this interactive guide on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)!

    ECC is a powerful public-key cryptographic system used to secure data in modern applications,
    from web browsing to cryptocurrency. This app will walk you through the core concepts,
    the mathematics, and its practical use.

st.write(
    "ECC is a public-key cryptography system based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. "
    "Unlike RSA, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, ECC's security is based on the "
    "**elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)**. This makes it highly efficient, offering "
    "the same level of security with much smaller key sizes."
